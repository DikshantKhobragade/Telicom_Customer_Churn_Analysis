# Telecom_Customer_Churn_Analysis
# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn to identify factors contributing to customer attrition and predict whether a customer is likely to churn. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing.
# Key Features
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualizations to understand the distribution of data and identify patterns.
- Insights into factors affecting customer churn, such as tenure, payment methods, and contract types.
### Data Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical data for model compatibility.
# Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
# Libraries:
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization.
# **Insights**
1. **Customer Tenure:** Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn. Retention programs targeted at newer customers can be effective in reducing churn.
2. **Monthly Charges:** High monthly charges are a key driver of churn. Consider offering discounts or tailored pricing plans for customers in higher charge brackets.
3. **Contract Type:** Customers on month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn compared to those on long-term contracts. Offering incentives for customers to switch to annual or longer-term contracts could improve retention.
4. **Payment Method:** Electronic check users have a higher churn rate. Encouraging the adoption of more stable payment methods, such as credit cards or automatic payments, may reduce churn.
5. **Demographics:** Certain demographic factors (e.g., senior citizens) may influence churn. Tailored services for specific customer segments could increase satisfaction.
